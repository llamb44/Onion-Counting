# Onion-Counting
Code to find the proportion of Food Network's recipes that use onions, yellow onions, or onion powder.

As part of a bio project, I wanted to find the proportion of yellow onions in human diets. In leau of going through every single recipe on the internet, I went through every recipe in Food Networks A-Z directory. If the recipe has yellow onions, onions, or onion powder, then the appropriate variable would be incremented. At the end, the code saves the raw count of the aforementinoed variables and the total number of recipes, as well as the proportions of these variables out of the total number of recipes.
